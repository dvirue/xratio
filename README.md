X Like/View Ratio is a simple Chrome/Edge extension that enhances the X (Twitter) web interface by showing an Engagement Ratio (ER) badge on every post.

🔹 Calculates ER as likes ÷ views × 100.
🔹 Works with numbers in multiple formats (579, 15K, 73 mil, 1.2M).
🔹 Automatically updates as you scroll the timeline.
🔹 Color-coded badges:
  🟢 Green = ER > 3%
  🟠 Amber = 1–3%
  🔴 Red = < 1%
🔹 All calculations happen locally in your browser — no data is collected or sent anywhere.
